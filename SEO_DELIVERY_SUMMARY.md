## 🎓 Key Insights for Your Team

### 1. What is Entity-Based SEO?
Google no longer just looks at keywords. It looks at:
- **Real Company**: BornoSoft exists
- **Real Founders**: Mohammad Ali Nayeem & Reduan Ahmed
- **Real Credentials**: Both went to DIU (Daffodil International University)
- **Real Services**: Web, Mobile, Cloud, AI
- **Real Locations**: Bangladesh, UAE, UK

This helps Google trust and rank you better.

### 2. Why Founder Names Matter
When you mention founder names with credentials:
- Google builds an "entity knowledge graph" about them
- Connects their authority to your company
- Makes your company more trustworthy
- Helps with branded searches
- Creates backlink opportunities (founder interviews, guest posts, etc.)

### 3. Why Natural Keywords Matter
Keyword stuffing (repeating keywords unnaturally):
- ❌ Gets penalized by Google
- ❌ Hurts user experience
- ❌ Doesn't rank

Natural keyword integration:
- ✅ Reads naturally
- ✅ Users enjoy it
- ✅ Google rewards it
- ✅ Better rankings

## 💡 Competitive Advantage

### What Makes This Better Than Generic SEO
